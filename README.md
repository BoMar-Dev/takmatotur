Welcome to the **Tak Mat o Tur** website repository!

This project involves creating a comprehensive website for Tak Mat o Tur, a new and dynamic company with a unique focus on running and outdoor adventures. With no prior online presence, this website has been built from the ground up to give Tak Mat o Tur a credible digital platform.

### Objective

The primary goal of this project was to develop the official website for Tak Mat o Tur, following a full-cycle development process. The site is designed to provide visitors with insights into the company's offerings, including running coaching, top-tour experiences, trail camps, and accommodation options.

### Project Background

After completing my studies as a Frontend Developer, I took the initiative to reach out to Tak Mat o Tur to offer my services in building their website. Working closely with the company, I handled every aspect of the site’s creation—from concept and photography to design and deployment. We collaborated on content and functionality, giving me creative freedom in design and visual presentation.

### Features

The website for Tak Mat o Tur includes the following key sections and features:

- **Homepage** - An overview of the company's ethos and offerings, introducing visitors to the world of Tak Mat o Tur.

- **Accommodation** - Overview of lodging options for guests attending events or exploring the area.

- **Contact** - A form for users to reach out for more information or booking inquiries.

### Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Node.js** - A JavaScript runtime for server-side operations.
- **Express** - A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js, handling form functionality.

### Tools & Process

To bring this project to life, I utilized various tools and methodologies:
